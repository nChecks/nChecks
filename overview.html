<p>NChecks is a library giving the power of Java to monitoring scripts written
    in Ruby.</p>
<h1>Monitoring scripts</h1>
<p>Monitoring scripts must be easily customizable or created, so they are not part of the jar. You must download the "base" files
<a href="https://github.com/sysmo-NMS/nchecks-base">here</a> (checkout the latest release matching your NChecks {major,minor} version) and:
<ul>
    <li>Put the ruby files in a directory accessible by the VM and initialize
        <a href="io/sysmo/nchecks/NChecksJRuby.html">NChecksJRuby.startJRubyCage(scriptPath, etcdir)</a>
        with the right <strong>scriptPath</strong> argument,</a></li>
    <li>Put the xml definition were it is accessible to the world.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Monitoring executables</h1>
<p>Some checks can't be done directly from the VM. For instance, ICMP requires
    a setuid executable to work correctly. So you must:
    <ul>
    <li>Build <a href="https://github.com/sysmo-nms/pping"> the Sysmo portable
    ping</a>,</li>
    <li>Put it in a directory which will be given as argument to
    <a href="io/sysmo/nchecks/checks/CheckICMP.html">CheckIcmp.setPping(ppingExecutable)</a></li>
    <li>Put the xml definition were it is accessible to the world.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>An working NChecks example is the NChecksErlang class.</p>
